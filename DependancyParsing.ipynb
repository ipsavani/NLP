        "A dependency parser analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence, establishing relationships between head words, and words which modify those heads. There are multiple types of dependency parsers, including transition-based parsers, graph-based parsers, and feature-based parsers. Your implementation will be a transition-based parser, which incrementally builds up a parse one step at a time. At every step it maintains a partial parse, which is represented as follows:\n",
        "* A *stack* of words that are currently being processed\n",
        "* A *buffer* of words yet to be processed.\n",
        "* A list of *dependencies* predicted by the parser.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, the stack only contains ROOT, the dependencies list is empty, and the buffer contains all words of the sentence in order. At each step, the parser applies a transition to the partial parse until its buffer is empty and the stack size is 1. The following transitions can be applied:\n",
        "* **SHIFT**: removes the first word from the buffer and pushes it onto the stack.\n",
        "* **LEFT-ARC**: marks the second (second most recently added) item on the stack as a dependent of the first item and removes the second item from the stack, adding a first word → second word dependency to the dependency list.\n",
        "* **RIGHT-ARC**: marks the first (most recently added) item on the stack as a dependent of the second item and removes the first item from the stack, adding a second word → first word dependency to the dependency list.\n",
